# Crowdsourcing Water Turbidity Information

This repository includes all files of our undergraduate project.

### Report Abstract

Water turbidity is one of the most important indicators for monitoring water quality, High turbidity is a good indication for presence of suspended particles in the water, such as sediments, organic matter, or pollutants [2], which may be harmful for drinking and can also harm aquatic life in these water sources, even if they are not directly harmful, they can still increase water turbidity, reducing the amount of light reaching plants and phytoplankton for photosynthesis, potentially disrupting the ecological balance of the water source and may lead to the development of diseases [3]. Additionally, monitoring water turbidity has other motivations, such as in underwater construction, diving and more.
Today, the primary method for measuring water turbidity is using a device called a Nephelometer, which measures the amount of light scattering in a water sample in units of NTU. Nephelometers are accurate but might be very expensive and difficult to operate and maintain, making them impractical for measuring water turbidity in remote and impoverished areas that are mostly in developing countries.
To address this issue, we propose measuring water turbidity using mobile phone camera, which is widely available today, along with low-cost and easy-to-produce calibration kits. The data from the test will be uploaded to the cloud for crowdsourcing. We will demonstrate through simulation that our idea can indeed be implemented and propose further developments.
